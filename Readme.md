Simple running/walking/cycling tracker.
Required access to user location.

For starting/finishing tracking session tap on button in top right corner of screen.
For mocking user location you can use [route through my hometown](https://github.com/kifio/Running-Tracker/blob/master/yegoryevsk.gpx).

Made as part of my personall challenge **#1week1app**
